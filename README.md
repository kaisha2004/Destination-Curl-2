# Destination-Curl

### Project Overview

Did you know that more than 60% of women have curly hair which makes for a mosaic of curl types, curl structures, and curl styles on display everyday. Recently there's been this revolution in hair to focus on curls. No longer are women, heating, straightening, or chemically treating their curls. They are wearing them proudly big, bold, and free. Destination Curl is the online e-commerce equivalent to Sephora for curly girls. We want them to feel at home on our site, while buying products with confidence because they trust us with their precious curls. Also, we want them to engage daily with the site and gain useful tips/tricks on how to love their curls. 

*designed for mobile devices (iPad and iPhone) as well

### MVP

The **Destination Curl** MVP will provide a good starting point for the website. It would introduce consumers to the website by first educating them on the different curl types on the landing page. The products featured would help the consumer make informed decisions on purchases with clickable links to the product page. Here, the consumer would find additional product info and links to learn more about he seller/brands featured. The site would also feature DIY Hairstyle ideas to make styling hair easier for consumers. Also, we want this to be collaborative as consumers will be able to upload their own styles. 

<br>

#### Goals

- Use (2) external Airtable data sets 
- Render API data from Airtable on page 
- Allow users to click on product images (which redirect to individual product pages)
- Allow users to create a post and upload Hairstyle ideas
- External links to seller pages on product pages
